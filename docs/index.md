<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SimiPixel/x_xy_v2/main/docs/img/coverage_badge.svg" height="20" />

## Installation

Supports `Python=3.10/3.11` (tested).

Install with `pip` using

`pip install 'x_xy[all] @ git+https://github.com/SimiPixel/x_xy_v2'`

Typically, this will install `jax` as cpu-only version. Afterwards, gpu-enabled version can be installed with
```bash
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda12_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

or with (if NVIDIA driver is a little older)
```bash
pip install --upgrade "jax[cuda11_pip]" -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_cuda_releases.html
```

### Dev Install

`pip install 'x_xy[dev] @ git+https://github.com/SimiPixel/x_xy_v2'`

## Documentation

Available [here](https://simipixel.github.io/x_xy_v2/).

### Known fixes

#### Offscreen rendering with Mujoco

> mujoco.FatalError: an OpenGL platform library has not been loaded into this process, this most likely means that a valid OpenGL context has not been created before mjr_makeContext was called

Solution:

```python
import os
os.environ["MUJOCO_GL"] = "egl"
```

## Publications
